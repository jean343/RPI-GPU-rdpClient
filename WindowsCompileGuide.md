###To compile the server in windows WITH NVIDIA card###
- Install BOOST
  - http://www.boost.org/users/download/
  - I downloaded boost_1_60_0-msvc-10.0-32.exe from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.60.0/ for Visual Studio 2010
- Install CMAKE, I took cmake-3.5.0-rc3-win32-x86.msi
  - http://www.cmake.org/install/
- Install Nvidia CUDA from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
- Open CMAKE
  - In the field: where is the source code, have the path to the subfolder Server from RPI-GPU-rdpClient git.
  - In the field: Where to build the binaries, make a subfolder build under Server
  - Press configure, I selected "Visual Studio 10 2010"
  - Click on Add Entry and enter BOOST_ROOT to the root of the Boost folder "C:/local/boost_1_60_0"
  - Do the same for BOOST_LIBRARYDIR and set it to "C:/local/boost_1_60_0/lib32-msvc-10.0"
  - I had to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR to "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v7.5"
  - Compile and Generate
  - It should look like the following:

- Open Server\build\server.sln in Visual Studio
  - Select Release and Build the Solution
- Open a command prompt and cd to Server\build\Release
  - Run "server monitor 0 port 8080"

  - Download FFMPEG from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/, need the dev and shared
    - Set FFMPEG_ROOT to the root of FFMPEG dev folder with the README.txt
      - In my case "RPI-GPU-rdpClient\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-20160307-git-6f5048f-win32-dev"
    - Add the bin folder of the shared zip to your path, or copy the DLLs
  - Uncheck USE_CUDA and USE_NVENC
  - Only keep USE_WDDM if you have Windows 8.0 or up
  - Compile and Generate
  - It should look like the following:
